## Usage

### Install

1. Save the contents of `cyberdream.yml` or `cyberdream-light.yml` to `~/.config/lazygit/config.yml`. If your `config.yml` doesn't exist, create the directory first with `mkdir -p ~/.config/lazygit`. If the config file already exists, you may want to back it up first.

See the [LazyGit documentation](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Config.md) for more information.
