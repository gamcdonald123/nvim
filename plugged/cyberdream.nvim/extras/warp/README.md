## Usage

### Install

1. Save the contents of either theme file:

    - Dark theme: Save `cyberdream.yaml` to `~/.warp/themes/cyberdream.yaml`
    - Light theme: Save `cyberdream-light.yaml` to `~/.warp/themes/cyberdream-light.yaml`

    If the directory doesn't exist, create it first with:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.warp/themes
    ```

2. Apply the theme through Warp:
    - Open Warp
    - Press `Cmd+P` (or `Ctrl+P` on Linux) to open the command palette
    - Type "Open Theme Picker"
    - Select either "cyberdream" or "cyberdream-light" from the available themes

See the [Warp Themes documentation](https://docs.warp.dev/appearance/custom-themes) for more information about custom themes.
